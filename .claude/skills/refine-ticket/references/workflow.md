# /refine-ticket — procedural workflow

Read this file before executing the skill. The skill hardens a Jira ticket against the rubric, looping until no gaps remain, then writes the refined ACs back to the ticket on approval. It does NOT generate tests — that is `/from-issue`'s job.

## 1. Parse arguments

- Required: a Jira issue key `<KEY>` (e.g. `SW-123`).
- Optional: `dry-run` — do everything except the Jira writes (see [`writeback-template.md`](writeback-template.md)).

## 2. Read the ticket

```bash
# Resolve the Atlassian cloudId, then fetch the issue.
```

Call `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` (cloudId), then `getJiraIssue` for `<KEY>` with `responseContentFormat: "adf"`. Capture the summary + the description's **ADF `content[]` array** — the write-back in Step 7 preserves the reporter's nodes verbatim, so it needs the real nodes, not a Markdown rendering of them. **If the ticket can't be read**, abort with the MCP error verbatim.

## 3. Discover sources

**First, sync the working branch with its remote** so the repo reads below (and the rubric's item-9 coverage-overlap check) see the latest merged work — a stale local branch is why an overlap can be missed (it makes item-9 wrongly report "no existing specs"). Require a clean tree; fast-forward only:

```bash
base=$(git branch --show-current)
git fetch origin "$base"
# clean tree required; if origin/$base exists: git merge --ff-only "origin/$base"
```

If the tree is dirty or the fast-forward fails (local diverged), don't force it — note it and proceed with the local state (refine-ticket only reads the repo; it never branches), but flag in the assumptions that coverage checks ran against a possibly-stale tree. If `origin/$base` has no counterpart, skip.

Then, per [`sources.md`](sources.md), consult sources in cheap→expensive order (repo reads → app docs → conventions). Do not yet ask the user — gather what ground truth exists first.

## 4. Score against the rubric

Apply every item in [`rubric.md`](rubric.md) to the Feature + each AC. Produce a **gap list**: each unmet item, tagged with which AC it belongs to. Also build the `assumptions[]` running list (every inference made from a source rather than the ticket).

## 5. Refinement loop

Repeat until the gap list is empty (or the user says "good enough"):

1. **Auto-resolve** every gap a source can answer; record each as an assumption.
2. **For residual gaps with no source**, ask the user a targeted, clustered question — offering **(a) answer directly** or **(b) point at a source** (Confluence / URL / doc path), per [`sources.md`](sources.md). Ingest any provided source.
3. **Re-score** (Step 4) with the new information.

**Never** silently guess a residual gap; either a source closes it or the user does. Abort ONLY if the ticket has no extractable behavior at all and the user provides nothing: _"Nothing testable in `<KEY>` and no source provided — cannot refine."_

## 6. Present for approval

Show the user, in one message:

- **Before → After** of the ACs (the hardened set).
- **Resolved assumptions** — the `assumptions[]` list (what was inferred and from where).
- **Coverage flags** — any rubric item-9 overlaps ("AC2 looks already covered by …").
- The exact `Refined Acceptance Criteria` block that will be written, shown as readable Markdown — say which lozenge each AC carries rather than printing raw ADF, which nobody can review. Structure and node types are in [`writeback-template.md`](writeback-template.md).

Ask: **"Write this back to `<KEY>`? (yes / edit / no)"**

## 7. Write back (on approval)

- **yes** → apply the idempotent description update via `editJiraIssue` with `contentFormat: "adf"`, then the audit comment via `addCommentToJiraIssue` (per [`writeback-template.md`](writeback-template.md)). Per ADR-0013 — both writes go through the MCP, never through `curl` and the REST API, because `allowed-tools` is what makes that boundary real. If a write fails, report the MCP error verbatim and emit the block locally so nothing is lost.
- **edit** → apply the user's tweaks, return to Step 6.
- **no** → emit the block in-session for manual paste; make NO Jira calls.
- **dry-run mode** → never write; print what would be written.

## 8. Hand off

Suggest the next step: _"`<KEY>` is refined. Run `/from-issue <KEY>` to generate tests — its Assumptions block should now be near-empty."_

Then report **Obstacles encountered** — ALWAYS, even when there are none (one line:
`Obstacles encountered: none.`). Per ADR-0022 it carries three things: tooling friction (a
Jira/Confluence MCP call that failed and was retried or worked around), reference gaps
(where `references/rubric.md` or `references/sources.md` did not cover the case and you
improvised — **name the file**), and any source you could not reach. Do NOT restate the
rubric gaps you already presented in Step 6.

This goes to the user in the terminal only. It is **never** written back to the ticket:
the write-back is the `Refined Acceptance Criteria` block alone (ADR-0013). Obstacles
are the agent's own process, not the ticket's content.

## Error handling (summary)

- Ticket unreadable → abort with MCP error verbatim.
- No sources + user provides none → still score + ask per gap; never invent ground truth.
- Decline at approval → no mutation; emit locally.
- Write fails → report verbatim; result preserved in-session.
- No live app: `/refine-ticket` never drives a running app. Facts not in the ticket/docs/automation are asked of the user; exact selectors/strings are `/from-issue`'s job at generation time.
