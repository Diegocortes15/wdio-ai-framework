//
// Gather one failure's evidence into a single folder a person can attach to a ticket.
//
// Why this exists: a bug report's Evidence section used to list absolute paths under
// `test-results/`, inside directories named things like
// `inventory-inventory-invent-6da45-products-by-price-ascending-chromium-problem`. Those paths
// are meaningless to anyone but the machine that ran the suite, so the section had, in
// practice, no evidence at all. This turns "hunt through mangled directories" into "attach
// this one folder".
//
// It COPIES; it never moves or deletes. The original run output is left untouched.
//
// Usage:  collect-evidence.mjs [--grep "<substring>"] [--out <dir>]
// Exit:   0   collected — the folder path and its contents are printed
//         3   the last run had no failures
//         4   no test-results/results.json — run the suite first
//         5   the failure was found but carried no evidence files
//
// Plain Node, no dependencies, mirroring collect-failure.mjs.
